This project is a React application built using Vite, designed to provide a seamless user experience with fast refresh capabilities and ESLint integration.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Pages**: Includes Home, Stories, Submit, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, and Terms pages.
- **Form Validation**: Implements robust validation for the Submit page to ensure data integrity.
- **Newsletter Signup**: Features a dedicated newsletter signup page with validation and success/error handling.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
